# Just my personal dotFiles

Feel free to use at your own risk though these should not be causing any problems as long as you are on similar platforms. Just for your info my machine is detailed below:


 - MacBook Pro Retina (Mid 2012)
 - OS X El Capitan (v10.11.3)
 - oh-my-zsh installed
 - Sublime Text's command-line tool installed. Of course you could switch that out for vim
 - Homebrew, NVM (for node and npm), RVM, RubyGems, Composer, etc. are all installed
 - MacVim installed
 - Installed Vim Plugins
	- 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'
	- 'tpope/vim-vinegar
	- 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
	- 'ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim'
	- 'rking/ag.vim'
	- 'skwp/greplace.vim'


Make sure you remove the aliases I have setup for some 'Places' (in .zshrc) since they won't work for you of course!!
